## How it works?

This app reads image with HTML 5 file api, and scale the image height to 7 pixel to git github's contribution size. And export a shell command let you run with your own git repository.

## Contribution

Fork the project and run following command in the project folder

```
npm install && bower install
```

Then `gulp serve` to start dev server, make sure your gulp version is newer than `3.9`
